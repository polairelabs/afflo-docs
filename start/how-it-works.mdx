Afflo connects three things: your store, your partners, and your payouts.

The simple flow
1) Connect your store (e.g., Shopify)
2) Invite or discover affiliates and creators
3) Share tracking links and discount codes
4) Watch sales and performance in your dashboard
5) Pay partners on a schedule that works for you

Where things live
- Dashboard: Your performance home
- Programs & Affiliates: Create programs and manage people
- Outreach: Find and contact new partners
- Payouts: Review and send payments
- Settings: Set up your store, team, and preferences

Tip: No coding required. Supabase is developer‑only under the hood — customers don’t need it.
